      What is best practice for hiding API keys in angular?
      I'm assuming that keys will be located on the back-end usually, but was curious of a good way to hide my key from Git, etc.
      I've seen using git .ignore, .env, but not sure the route I should take
      (and for my current case, implementing Google Places API, it has to be included as a <script> src)
  -->
  <script
    type="text/javascript" async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyCHB2iGhcuOoU4_eEsYtQA4d5hfs69EFDI&libraries=places">
  </script>
